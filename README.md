# Roblox Binary Launch
I wrote this sometime last year so I could launch directly into roblox versions bruteforced from [roblox deployment channels](https://setup.rbxcdn.com/channel/zcanary/DeployHistory.txt).

thanks to reggie @ latte softworks, for providing me a massive dump of channels at that time, they also have a proprietary channel tracker in their [discord](https://latte.to/discord), 
as well as an archived [channel tracker project](https://github.com/latte-soft/channel-tracker/) if you're interested!

(also lets you bypass updates >:) )
